## Introduction

OrchAI is an agentic AI framework that creates orchestrator agents and their sub-agents to complete both simple and complex tasks. The framework is designed to facilitate the development of modular, scalable, and intelligent agent-based systems.

## Architecture

### Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the central component of the OrchAI framework. It is responsible for managing and coordinating the sub-agents to complete tasks. The orchestrator receives tasks, assigns them to the appropriate sub-agents, and monitors their progress.

Key responsibilities of the orchestrator include:
- Task management: Receiving, assigning, and tracking tasks.
- Agent coordination: Ensuring sub-agents work together efficiently.
- Error handling: Managing errors and exceptions that occur during task execution.

### Sub-Agents

Sub-agents are modular components that perform specific tasks assigned by the orchestrator. Each sub-agent is designed to handle a particular type of task, allowing for a high degree of specialization and modularity.

Key responsibilities of sub-agents include:
- Task execution: Performing the tasks assigned by the orchestrator.
- Reporting: Providing status updates and results to the orchestrator.
- Error handling: Managing errors and exceptions that occur during task execution.

## Design Principles

The design of the OrchAI framework is guided by the following principles:

- **Modularity:** The framework is composed of modular components (orchestrator and sub-agents) that can be easily extended and maintained.
- **Scalability:** The framework is designed to handle a large number of tasks and agents, allowing it to scale with the needs of the application.
- **Intelligence:** The framework leverages AI and machine learning techniques to enable intelligent decision-making and task execution.

## Workflow

The workflow of the OrchAI framework can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Task Creation:** A task is created and submitted to the orchestrator.
2. **Task Assignment:** The orchestrator assigns the task to the appropriate sub-agent(s) based on their capabilities and availability.
3. **Task Execution:** The sub-agent(s) execute the task and provide status updates to the orchestrator.
4. **Task Completion:** Once the task is completed, the sub-agent(s) report the results to the orchestrator.
5. **Error Handling:** If any errors or exceptions occur during task execution, the orchestrator and sub-agent(s) handle them appropriately.
